## Objective of ZKP

- Prove to someone ( the verifier ) that I (the prover ) have a piece of information that satisfies a criteria without showing them the information

## Characteristics of ZK
 
 1. Will require <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">**_a setup_**</span> and rules of interaction
 2. Needs to throw <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">**_challenge_**</span> to probe the truth (not observable to verifier).
 3. The challenge questions probe the feature, capacity, function, unique characteristics of the unobservable truth.
 4. Verification succeeds when verifier is sufficiently convinced with a response prover gives. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">_Acceptance condition_</span>
 5. Will always have an element of uncertainty. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">**_100% certain conclusion is not possible._**</span>
